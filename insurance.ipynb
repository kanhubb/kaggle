        "\n",
        "This code defines a preprocessing pipeline for cleaning and preparing the dataset before training a machine learning model. The pipeline consists of several custom transformers, each focusing on specific preprocessing tasks. Below is an explanation of each component:\n",
        "\n",
        "## 1. **DateTransformer**\n",
        "- Extracts features from the `Policy Start Date` column, such as:\n",
        "  - Year, Month, Day, Week, Day of the week, and Month name.\n",
        "  - Cyclical features for Year, Month, and Day using sine (`sin`) and cosine (`cos`) transformations.\n",
        "- Creates a grouping feature based on year, month, and day.\n",
        "- Removes the original `Policy Start Date` column after transformation.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 2. **ContractLengthTransformer**\n",
        "- Creates a new feature, `contract length`, by binning the `Insurance Duration` into three categories:\n",
        "  - Short-term (≤1 year), Mid-term (2–3 years), and Long-term (>3 years).\n",
        "- Handles missing values by assigning them to a default category.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 3. **MissingValueTransformer**\n",
        "- Imputes missing numerical values with statistical measures:\n",
        "  - Mean for most numerical features.\n",
        "  - Median for `Credit Score` and `Vehicle Age`.\n",
        "  - Zero for `Number of Dependents` and `Previous Claims`.\n",
        "- Fills missing categorical values with the most frequent value (mode).\n",
        "- Handles specific categorical columns like `Marital Status`, `Occupation`, and `Customer Feedback`.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 4. **CategoricalTransformer**\n",
        "- Converts all object-type columns into categorical data types, enabling better handling by machine learning models.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 5. **Pipeline Integration**\n",
        "- The transformers are combined into a `Pipeline` object, which ensures that all preprocessing steps are applied in sequence.\n",
        "- The pipeline is fitted to the training dataset (`df_train`) and transformed versions of both the training and test datasets are produced.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Key Benefits:\n",
        "- **Modular Design**: Each preprocessing step is encapsulated in a separate transformer, making the pipeline modular and reusable.\n",
        "- **Automated Handling**: Automatically processes dates, handles missing values, and prepares categorical features.\n",
        "- **Consistency**: Ensures consistent transformations between training and test datasets.\n",
        "\n",
        "By using this pipeline, we ensure the dataset is clean, features are well-engineered, and ready for model training.\n"
